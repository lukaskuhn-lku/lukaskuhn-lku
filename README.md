👋 Hi, I’m Lukas

🖥️ I am a Cloud & Machine Learning Engineer mostly working with C++, C#, Python and Javascript. You can find my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukas-kuhn-86a978106/) to have a look at my previous work experience.

🚀 In my spare time I like to contribute to Open-Source, go for a walk with my dog and read books. 

➡️ Check out my [leetcode solutions](https://github.com/lukaskuhn-lku/leetcode) and my newest demo 🎲 [Reinforced TicTacToe](https://lukaskuhn-lku.github.io/reinforced-tictactoe/)
